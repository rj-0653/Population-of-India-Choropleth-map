# Population-of-India-Choropleth-map

A choropleth map is a thematic map that represents statistical data using color mapping symbology. In this project, we aim to visualize the population of Indian states using Plotly to create an interactive and informative choropleth map.

# Data Source

The population data used in this project is based on the 2011 Census of India. The dataset includes the population figures for each state and union territory in India.

# Technologies Used

Python
Pandas
Plotly

# Description

We use the Plotly library in Python to create an interactive choropleth map that displays the population of Indian states. The color intensity on the map represents the population density, allowing users to quickly grasp the population distribution across different states.
